#Functional Programming Workshop from Node School

This is part of the electives of Node School, however I started here since I am 
working through [FreeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.com)  which has takes you through
the basics with [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn). I got to the 
functional programming section and struggled through (http://jhusain.github.io/learnrx).

That is when I found this workshop as well as  these [Essential JavaScript Links](https://github.com/natac13/essential-javascript-links)
